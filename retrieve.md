There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using arithmetic coding on the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence".[19][20][21]

Ada: The relationship between compression and intelligence is very interesting. This link comes from the commonalities between machine learning and data compression. A system that is capable of predicting posterior probabilities of a sequence given its history can be used effectively for data compression. Arithmetic coding on the output distribution is a particular method that has found application. 

Simultaneously, a compressor that is optimally designed can assist in prediction tasks where the symbol that best compresses given the prior history is needed. This unique interaction has led to a perspective where data compression is seen as a benchmark for "general intelligence". This view is manifest in fields like machine learning and AI.
